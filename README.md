# Face Detection Door Control: Automating Entry with Python and Arduino
*A smart, contactless, and efficient door control system that uses face detection and automation technology.*

---

## üìÑ Project Description
This project automates door access using face recognition technology. A camera captures live video and uses Python‚Äôs OpenCV library to detect faces. When a face is detected, a command is sent to the Arduino, which triggers a servo motor to open the door. If no face is detected, an LED lights up to indicate restricted access. This system is ideal for smart homes, offices, and other security-focused areas.

## üåç Real-World Impact
- **Enhanced Security**: Provides a secure, contactless method for door access.
- **Increased Convenience**: Automates the process of opening and closing doors, making it ideal for smart home systems.
- **Hygienic Access**: Touch-free entry, especially useful in healthcare facilities and public spaces to minimize the spread of germs.

## ‚úÖ Solution Overview
This project replaces traditional access systems with an automated face detection mechanism, enhancing efficiency and security. By integrating Python‚Äôs face detection capabilities with Arduino hardware control, it provides a seamless and effective solution for door automation.

## üß© Components and Their Descriptions
1. **Arduino Board**: A microcontroller used for controlling the servo motor and LED.
2. **Servo Motor**: Opens or closes the door based on the face detection status.
3. **LED**: Lights up to indicate restricted access when no face is detected.
4. **Camera**: Captures live video for face detection.
5. **Wires and Breadboard**: Used for assembling the hardware setup and making electrical connections.

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Software, Tools, and Packages
- **Arduino IDE**: To upload and run code on the Arduino board.
- **Python 3.x**: For running the face detection logic.
- **PySerial Library**: Handles serial communication between Python and Arduino.
- **OpenCV**: A Python library for real-time computer vision and face detection.
- **cvzone.FaceDetectionModule**: Simplifies face detection using OpenCV.

### Installation
1. **Install Python and OpenCV**:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install cvzone
   ```
2. **Install PySerial**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyserial
   ```
3. **Setup Arduino IDE**: Download and install from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

## üöÄ How It Works
1. **Face Detection**: The camera captures video and uses OpenCV to detect faces in real-time.
2. **Sending Commands**: When a face is detected, Python sends a signal ('1') to the Arduino to open the door using the servo motor. If no face is detected, a signal ('2') is sent to turn on the LED.
3. **Arduino Control**: The Arduino interprets the commands and controls the servo motor and LED accordingly.
